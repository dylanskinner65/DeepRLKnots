This is the code repository for my honors thesis!

My thesis title is: Using Deep Learning Techniques to Find the 4D Slice Genus of a Knot, with abstract:

Deep reinforcement learning (DRL) has proven to be exceptionally effective in addressing challenges 
related to pattern recognition and problem-solving, particularly in domains where human intuition faces limitations. 
Within the field of knot theory, a significant obstacle lies in the construction of minimal-genus slice surfaces for knots of varying complexity. 
This thesis presents a new approach harnessing the capabilities of DRL to address this challenging problem. 
By employing braid representations of knots, our methodology involves training reinforcement learning agents to generate minimal-genus slice surfaces. 
The agents achieve this by identifying optimal sequences of braid transformations with respect to a defined objective function.

Ultimately, we used PPO to try and find the minimal slice genus of a knot. You can find all my code here, including my implementation of PPO!
